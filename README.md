##Description:

This repository contains implementations of text generation models using GPT-2 and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks). These models can be trained on custom datasets to generate human-like text. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and text generation scripts, allowing users to fine-tune AI models for various applications such as chatbots, creative writing, and AI-powered content generation.
Project Overview
This project leverages deep learning and NLP techniques to train two different text generation models:
GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2)
A transformer-based model capable of generating coherent, context-aware text.
Uses pre-trained weights from OpenAI’s GPT-2 model and can be fine-tuned on custom datasets.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Network)
A recurrent neural network (RNN) optimized for sequential text generation.
Trained from scratch on tokenized datasets for word prediction and sentence completion.
How It Works
Data Preparation
The dataset is tokenized using NLTK and TensorFlow's Keras Tokenizer.
Text sequences are converted into numerical representations for model training.
Model Training
The GPT-2 model is fine-tuned using Hugging Face's Transformers library.
The LSTM model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on tokenized sequences.
Text Generation
Users can input a prompt, and the trained models will predict and generate text based on learned patterns.
GPT-2 generates contextually rich responses, while LSTM provides structured text completion.
Project Features
 Fine-tuning GPT-2 on Custom Data – Adjusts the model for domain-specific text generation.
 LSTM-Based Word Prediction – Learns sentence structures for predictive text.
 Tokenizer for Preprocessing – Efficiently processes input text into a structured format.
 Optimized Training – Uses batch processing, mixed precision, and efficient memory handling.
 Configurable Generation Parameters – Allows control over creativity, randomness, and sequence length.
Installation & Dependencies
Install the required libraries using:
pip install transformers torch datasets tensorflow nltk keras
The project requires:
Transformers & Torch – For GPT-2 training and inference.
NLTK & TensorFlow – For tokenization and LSTM training.
